After charging, deal damage up to **188.6%** of ATK plus **10**. Upon hitting targets that are not burning, inflict them with Cross Burn, which deals damage equal to **75%** of ATK every second for **13** seconds. Upon hitting burning targets, inflict them with Cross Burn, and enter Burn Enhancement for **20** seconds, which increases bum damage on targets by **20%**. When using Twilight Arc, you now throw **3** grenades instead. **Deceitful Bomb**: Changes the effects of Cross Snipe into a ranged Gas attack that deals base damage equal to **42.6%** of ATK plus **2** upon hit. After charging, deal up to **294.1%** of ATK plus **15**. Targets in the Gas will be slowed. The slow effect becomes stronger over time, and the Gas lasts **7** seconds. Twilight Arc can detonate the Gas (the longer the charge, the greater the Gas explosion damage), dealing explosion damage up to **316.2%** of ATK plus **17** (this is deemed as triggering Cross Snipe 1 time) and reducing the target's flame resistance by **10%** for **10** seconds. **Passive**: After confirming the module, you will receive Optical Enhancement corresponding to the number of dodge attempt recoveries and Cross Snipe charge time reductions. Optical Enhancement: Reduces the charging time of Cross Snipe by **30%**, becoming immune to control effects while charging. Recover **1** dodge attempt (up to **4** dodge attempts) every **2** dodges. **Passive**: While the Deceitful Bomb Module is in effect, Cross Snipe has a chance of reducing the cooldown of other flame weapon skills by **0.7** seconds after hitting a target. **Passive Tranquil Heart**: When Clover Cross uses discharge/skill/charged attack/dodge, increase final crit rate of Clover Cross by **3.5%** for **15** seconds. This effect can stack up to **3** times. After crit rate exceeds **100%**, **50%** of the excess crit rate is converted to crit damage, up to a maximum of **5.25%** crit damage."
